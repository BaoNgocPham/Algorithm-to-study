#Recall that the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers A and B is the largest integer that divides both A and B.

a = int(input("input a "))
b = int(input("input b "))
# method to compute gcd ( Euclidean algo )
#the first way:
def computeGCD(a, b):
    temp = 0
    while b:
        temp = b
        b = a % b
        a = temp
        print(a,b) # just to check how a and b change time through time
    return abs(a) #till the end, when b= 0 means False, a= GDC. abs() make sure that a>0

print("The gcd of a and b is : ", computeGCD(a, b))

#the most DRY way:
def computeGCD(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b #b value assign to a, the remainder of a:b assign to b.
    return abs(a) 

print("The gcd of a and b is : ", computeGCD(a, b))
